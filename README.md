# LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions – C++

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey of solving LeetCode daily challenges using C++. This repository is not only a reflection of my problem-solving efforts but also a learning log that helps me grow as a programmer.

## 📌 About This Repository

- 🧠 **Daily Challenges:** Includes solutions to LeetCode’s daily challenges.
- 🔍 **Problem Descriptions:** Automatically saved using the **LeetHub v2** extension.
- ✍️ **My Approach:** For each problem, I write my thought process and the approach I took to solve the problem.
- 🧪 **Trial & Error:** I am not an expert coder yet, but I make a consistent effort to improve. I sometimes start with incorrect or suboptimal approaches, but I always strive to learn from them.

## 🔧 Tools & Resources Used

- [LeetHub v2 Extension](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub): To sync problems and solutions from LeetCode directly to this repo.
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/): For concept clarification.
- [Love Babbar’s DSA Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA): For understanding coding techniques and implementation.
- **ChatGPT:** For brainstorming, optimizing solutions, and getting coding assistance.

## 🚀 Why I Started This Repo

This repository serves as:

- A personal progress tracker.
- A platform to revise and reflect on previously solved problems.
- A way to share my learning journey with others.
- A source of motivation to stay consistent in coding practice.

## 📈 Goals

- Improve problem-solving and analytical thinking.
