# Solution
# Counting Complete Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

## Problem Statement

You are given an **undirected graph** with `n` vertices, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a **2D integer array** `edges`, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes an **undirected edge** connecting vertices `a_i` and `b_i`.

A **connected component** is a subgraph where:
- There exists a **path** between every pair of vertices within that component.
- No vertex of the component shares an edge with a vertex outside the component.

A connected component is **complete** if there exists an **edge between every pair** of its vertices.

### Example 1
#### **Input:**
```cpp
n = 6
edges = {{0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}, {3,4}}
```
#### **Graph Representation:**
```
Component 1: 0 - 1 - 2 (Complete)
Component 2: 3 - 4 (Complete)
Component 3: 5 (Single node, Complete)
```
#### **Output:**
```cpp
3
```

### Example 2
#### **Input:**
```cpp
n = 6
edges = {{0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}, {3,4}, {3,5}}
```
#### **Graph Representation:**
```
Component 1: 0 - 1 - 2 (Complete)
Component 2: 3 - 4 - 5 (Not Complete, missing 4-5 edge)
Component 3: 6 (Single node, Complete)
```
#### **Output:**
```cpp
1
```

## **Approach: Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**
To efficiently find connected components and determine if they are **complete**, we use **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) with Path Compression and Union by Rank**.

### **Data Structures Used**
- `par[i]`: Stores the **parent (representative)** of each node.
- `rank[i]`: Helps with **Union by Rank** to keep the tree balanced.
- `count[i]`: Stores the **size** of each connected component.
- `edge[i]`: Tracks the **number of edges** within each component.

### **Algorithm Steps**
1. **Initialize DSU**:
   - Each node is its own **parent**.
   - Set **count = 1** (each node is its own component initially).
   - Set **edge = 0** (no edges initially).

2. **Process Each Edge**:
   - Use **Find Parent (Path Compression)** to get root parent.
   - Use **Union by Rank** to merge components.
   - Update `count` and `edge` accordingly.

3. **Count Complete Components**:
   - A **component is complete** if it contains exactly `count * (count - 1) / 2` edges (fully connected graph formula).
   - Iterate over **parent nodes** and count how many satisfy this condition.

## **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Find Parent (Path Compression)**: `O(Î±(n))` (near constant time)
- **Union by Rank**: `O(Î±(n))`
- **Processing `m` edges**: `O(m Î±(n))`
- **Final component check**: `O(n)`
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(n + m)` (Efficient for `n â‰¤ 50`)

---

## **Edge Cases Considered**
âœ… **No edges (`edges = []`)**: Each node is its own complete component.
âœ… **All nodes connected (clique)**: Should return `1`.
âœ… **Multiple disconnected components**.
âœ… **Graph with isolated nodes**.

---

## **Summary**
âœ… **Efficiently finds connected components** using DSU.  
âœ… **Uses Union by Rank & Path Compression** for optimization.  
âœ… **Correctly checks for complete components** using edge count formula.  
âœ… **Handles all edge cases optimally**.  

This **DSU-based approach** provides an optimal solution for counting **complete connected components** in an **undirected graph**. ðŸš€
